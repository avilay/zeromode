## Our Mission

ZeroMode is a robotics company focused on building the "brains" for autonomous systems. We develop software that enables robots to navigate, perceive, and interact with complex real-world environments.

## Who We Are

ZeroMode is led by **Avilay**, a software engineer with deep experience in machine learning, computer vision, and autonomous systems. With a background spanning both industry and research, Avilay brings a practical, systems-level approach to building intelligent robots.

## What We Do

We work at the intersection of:

- **Autonomous Navigation** -- Path planning and obstacle avoidance for mobile robots
- **Computer Vision** -- Real-time perception and scene understanding
- **Robot Manipulation** -- Grasping and object interaction using learned policies
- **Simulation** -- Developing and testing robot behaviors in realistic virtual environments
