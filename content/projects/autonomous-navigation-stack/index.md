## Key Features

- **SLAM Integration** -- Real-time simultaneous localization and mapping
- **Dynamic Path Planning** -- Adaptive path planning that responds to changing environments
- **Obstacle Avoidance** -- Multi-sensor fusion for robust obstacle detection and avoidance
- **Modular Architecture** -- Swap out individual components without affecting the rest of the stack

## Status

This project is currently in active development. Check back for updates.
